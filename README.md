I am not the maintainer of NILE.  [I am building this flatpak as a test distrubion for junkstore, based on ebruns' legendary flatpak](https://github.com/ebenbruyns/legendary-flatpak/blob/master/com.github.derrod.legendary.yml).

# setup and install

-  Install flatpak-builder
- get the GNOME SDK and Platform

```bash
 flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Sdk//45
 flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//45

```
